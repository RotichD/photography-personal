# Photography Portfolio - Dylan Rotich

## Description

I built this project to showcase my artwork as a photographer and further my skills as a Front End Web Developer.
- I needed a portfolio website w/ blog to showcase my work as a photographer (long standing hobby)
- I used NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and Sanity CMS to challenge myself to practice known concepts while still learning new frameworks and libraries.
- I learned how to create Sanity Schemas, implement Groq queries, integrate Stripe checkouts, debug Type errors, and use TailwindCSS to implement mobile first development.
- Demonstrates ability to create portfolio website for clients
